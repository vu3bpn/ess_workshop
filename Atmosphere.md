## Chapter 1: Introduction to the Atmosphere
- What is the Atmosphere?
The atmosphere is the thin layer of air, or a gaseous envelope, that surrounds the Earth, held in place by gravity. This "protective bubble" provides the air we breathe, shields us from the Sun's harmful radiation, traps heat to maintain a habitable temperature, and helps regulate Earth's climate and water cycle. It's a dynamic system composed of different
- Composition of the Atmosphere
  - Major and Minor Gases
  - Variable Components (e.g., Water Vapor, Aerosols)
- Layers of the Atmosphere
  - Troposphere
  - Stratosphere
## The stratosphere is Earth's second atmospheric layer, extending from the top of the troposphere (around 12-50 km##) to the mesosphere, characterized by the ozone layer which protects from harmful UV radiation.
  - Mesosphere
  - Thermosphere
  - Exosphere
- Boundaries of Each Layer
  - Tropopause
  - Stratopause
  - Mesopause
- Characteristics of Each Layer

## Chapter 2: The Troposphere
